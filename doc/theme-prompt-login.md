1. Brand
```txt
A captivating admin login page with a full-screen, vibrant vector illustration as the background. The illustration features an expansive scene, perhaps a stylized office environment, a network of connected devices, or an abstract representation of digital processes, using a rich but harmonious color scheme. In the foreground, a simple, semi-transparent login panel or a white card is perfectly centered, containing only the 'Username', 'Password' fields, and a 'Log In' button. The illustration enhances the brand story without distracting from the login process. Storytelling UI, engaging, brand-focused, SaaS application.

3. Matrix
```txt
A high-tech admin login page, dark mode. The entire background is a dynamic "Matrix digital rain" effect, with green Katakana, Japanese characters, and numbers (like '01アイウエオカキクケコ') cascading vertically down a black screen. The leading character of each stream is bright white, fading to green. In the center, a simple, sharp login form floats directly on the code rain. The form consists only of minimalist glowing green outlines for the 'Username' and 'Password' input fields and a solid green 'LOGIN' button. Futuristic, cyberpunk aesthetic, secure, minimal UI.

4. Split
```txt
A split-screen admin login page. The left side is a solid, clean dark grey or black panel containing a professional, minimalist login form with white text. The right side is a visually striking, full-height panel showing a "Matrix digital rain" of cascading green and white Japanese Katakana characters ('01アイウエオカキクケコ'). The two panels are divided by a single, thin, glowing green vertical line. Secure, corporate-tech, futuristic, professional UI/UX design.
