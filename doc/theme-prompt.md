1. Brand
```txt
A captivating admin application UI design. The entire application background features a full-screen, soft-focus, and vibrant vector illustration (perhaps a stylized digital network or abstract office scene) that subtly tells the brand's story. All functional components—like the side navigation, content panels, data tables, and modals—are designed as semi-transparent "frosted glass" (glassmorphism) or clean white cards that float above the background, creating a sense of depth. Key UI elements like buttons and active links use a rich, harmonious brand color palette. The overall feel is engaging, premium, and brand-focused. Storytelling UI, SaaS application.

2. Modern
```txt
A modern and friendly admin application UI. The layout features a clean white or light-grey main content area and a distinct sidebar (perhaps a light color or a solid brand color). The design uses rounded corners extensively: for input fields, buttons, and content cards. A single, vibrant accent color (like teal or orange) is used for all interactive elements (buttons, active navigation links, icons) to ensure a friendly feel. Dashboards and empty states feature high-quality, flat-style vector illustrations depicting teamwork or data analysis. Typography is clean, sans-serif, and highly legible. Overall aesthetic is professional, welcoming, and minimalist.

3. Matrix
```txt
A high-tech, futuristic admin application UI in dark mode. The primary theme is an immersive "Matrix" cyberpunk aesthetic. The main navigation sidebar and the top header feature a dynamic "Matrix digital rain" effect with cascading green Katakana and numbers. The main content area is a solid black or very dark grey to ensure data (tables, forms) is readable. All text, icons, and data charts use a glowing green monochrome palette. Focused input fields and active buttons have a bright, glowing green outline. Modals and pop-ups float directly on the UI with a subtle glow. Futuristic, secure, developer tool UI.
```

4. Split
```txt
A professional, split-layout admin application UI. The interface is visually divided by a single, thin, glowing green vertical line. The left panel is a fixed navigation sidebar, using a solid, clean dark grey or black background with minimalist white text and glowing green icons for active items. The main content area (right panel) is a lighter dark grey, presenting forms, data tables, and dashboards with sharp, clean white text and green accents. The design feels secure, corporate-tech, and futuristic. Ideal for a fin-tech or security application.
